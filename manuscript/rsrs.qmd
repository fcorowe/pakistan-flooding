Global warming is increasing the frequency of extreme weather events, natural disasters and large-scale population displacements.
Pakistan is a current example of such events.
Since June 2022, Pakistan has suffered destructive flash flooding.
As of 3 September 2022, a third of the country was estimated to be underwater [@Reuters2022].
Pakistan has the largest number of glaciers outside polar regions and higher temperatures have led to excess of water from melting ice in the Himalayas.
Sudden outbursts of melting glacier water, coupled with torrential monsoon rainfall and long-term deforestation, have thus contributed to landslides, floods and the overflowing of the the Indus River which stretches 2,880 km across Pakistan from north to south.
Since June 2022, 33 million people are estimated to have been affected, over 1,500 killed and over 6,000 injured as a result of damaged or collapsing housing and public infrastructure [@Reuters2022].
The southern-eastern province of Sindh is the worst affected area [@Reuters2022].

The scale of the humanitarian crisis is anticipated to be unprecedented.
Floodwater have swept away infrastructure, crops, livestock and livelihoods.
Limited agricultural production is likely to add pressure to the existing cost of living crisis due to post-pandemic supply chain disruptions and ongoing war in Ukraine [@aminetzahetal_2022].
Additionally, waterborne diseases are expected to start spreading in the coming weeks.
Dengue cases have already began soaring following record floods in August [@bbc2022].
Shelter, clean drinking water and food are urgently needed items in Pakistan.

Geographically granular data in real time are critical to monitor population displacement and support the provision of humanitarian aid where it is needed [@rowe2022] .
Traditional data systems are not regularly updated, costly and characterised by slow data collection and release [@green2021] .
We use digital footprint data to capture population movements in near-real time.
Specifically, we use spatially aggregate, privacy-preserving location history data from Facebook users to identify changes in local population (@fig-fig1 during 13 August-7 September 2022 and human mobility patterns (@fig-fig2 (b)) on 15 August the day Pakistan declared a state of emergency.
Percentage changes in population correspond to the difference between day-specific populations and a baseline period.
The baseline period covers 45 days going back 12 August.

@fig-fig1 reveals a persistent pattern of population decline in areas along the Indus River.
Declines in these areas exceed 20 percent of the Facebook population during the baseline period.
@fig-fig1 also suggests that people started leaving areas in Sindh from 18 August.
Northern-eastern areas of the Indus River record less pronounced population changes, while southern areas of Balochistan showed population increases, particularly since 25 August.
@fig-fig2 (b) reveals central nodes of departure reflecting people moving away from towns and cities along the Indus River, and large numbers moving to Islamabad from neighbouring areas in the north of the country.
The figures presented here offer an illustrative example of the potential of digital footprint data to support rapid humanitarian responses and ensure the delivery of assistance where it is needed.
At the same time, I emphasise a need to carefully considered the methodological and ethical challenges relating to biases, representation and privacy of these data as they have not been purposely build for academic research [@rowe2021].
